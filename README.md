# Welcome to my Neovim Configuration repository!

I built this config because I have been curious about neovim, simplifying the coding experience, and to learn more 
about my computer's operating system and the terminal. 

I built this config by watching ThePrimeAgen's 0 to LSP: Neovim RC From Scratch to guide myself as I built the config
but I am not using the majority of his remaps. I also decided to keep some stuff from my previous IDEs, like the atom onedark 
pro colorscheme, which I have been using since I first started coding in Atom in highschool. 

If you want to use this config, feel free to clone the repo and check it out! I recommend using Ghostty or a similar terminal
emulator that supports full colors, as the vanilla MacOS terminal will not properly render the colorscheme and it will leave 
you with a cyan-like terminal that is uglier than the vanilla nvim scheme.
